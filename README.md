# webkeys

Cross browser key event mangement in ClojureScript

As this is a pre-release version **webkeys** has not been
published to [Clojars](https://clojars.org/). You can still clone it and install
it locally.

Check out the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

The motivation for **webkeys** is to implement a cross browser
approach to keyboard events that provides simple string based
keybindings (including chording meta keys). This might not be
necessary if [KeyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) was handled consistently by browsers.

## Documentation

The **webkeys** library was developed to support the [PAMELA](https://github.com/dollabs/pamela) suite of tools.

*TBD* API docs (will be linked from [dollabs.github.io](http://dollabs.github.io/))

## Building

The **webkeys** library uses [boot](http://boot-clj.com/) as a build tool.

Check [here for more information on setting up boot](https://github.com/dollabs/plan-schema#building).

You can install **webkeys** locally with `boot local`.

You can get help for all available boot tasks with `boot -h`.
